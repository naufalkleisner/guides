## What is PHP?

PHP is a server-side scripting language created in 1995 by Rasmus Lerdorf.

## What does the acronym PHP stand for?

Originally PHP stood for 'Personal Home Page', as Rasmus Lerdorf created it for use on his own website. Then in 1997 more developers expanded the language and the acronym also changed to what it stands for today: 'PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor'. As the first 'P' in PHP also stands for 'PHP', it is known as a 'recursive acronym'.

## What is PHP used for?

It is typically used to generate web page content dynamically. For example, if you have a blog website, you might write some PHP scripts to retrieve your blog posts from a database and display them. Other things that PHP scripts could be used for include:

* Processing and saving user input from form data
* Setting and working with website cookies
* Restricting access to certain pages of your website

## How does PHP work?

All PHP code is executed on a web server only, not on your local computer. For example, if you complete a form on a website and submit it, or click a link to a web page written in PHP, no actual PHP code runs on your computer. Instead, the form data or request for the web page gets sent to a web server to be processed by the PHP scripts. The web server then sends the processed HTML back to you (which is where 'Hypertext Preprocessor' in the name comes from), and your web browser displays the results. For this reason, you cannot see the PHP code of a website, only the resulting HTML that the PHP scripts have produced.


## PHP vs. Other Technologies

Many developers working in other technologies which are also interested to work in PHP, for example JSP, ASP, Perl, ColdFusion are name of few. Usually it’s a matter of preference and the cost involved that urges developers to pick PHP one over the other. May be different opinions about it, but most of PHP developers believe that PHP is easier to learn and has a superior syntax than other languages. Additionally PHP is fast and safe, and on top of all it’s free.
